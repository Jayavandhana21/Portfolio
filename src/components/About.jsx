              Hello! I‚Äôm a passionate Computer Science and Data Analytics graduate
              from PSG College of Arts & Science in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. I‚Äôve
              always been curious about how things work on the web, which led me to
              dive deep into front-end development.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have a strong foundation in programming languages like Python and
              JavaScript. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and engaging interfaces
              using React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. I love turning ideas into
              real, functional websites that not only work well but also look great.
              <br />
              <br />
              I‚Äôve gained practical experience as a Web Developer Intern at Hashmato,
              where I worked on websites for restaurants in Singapore. I‚Äôm always
              eager to learn and explore new areas in software development.
              <br />
              <br />
              I also participate in extracurricular activities and hold certifications
              in Cyber Security.
